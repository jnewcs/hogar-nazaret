<p>We greatly appreciate the wonderful efforts of the Board of Directors to make this event a reality, especially the organizing committee led by Miriam Almodovar (Deputy Secretary of the Board of Directors), Agnes Rivera (Deputy Treasurer and President of the organizing committee) and Jesús Morales (Vice President).
