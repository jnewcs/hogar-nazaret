        <h3>General Information about the Hogar</h3>

        <p>El Hogar Albergue para Niños Jesús de Nazaret (The Hogar) is a Mayagüez non-profit institution dedicated to sheltering, caring for, protecting, and meeting the basic needs of children from newborns to 12 years of age who have been removed from their homes for being victims of physical violence, sexual abuse, or neglect. The Hogar opened its doors in May 1995. It was founded by a group of citizens from the western area of the island led by Don Jesús Morales Rodríguez and his wife Carmen Cordero, civic leaders of the community of Mayagüez, who upon learning of the growing incidence of child abuse in Puerto Rico, solicited the collaboration of other citizens and worked tirelessly for 5 years to make The Hogar a reality.</p>

        <p>The Hogar welcomes minors ranging from newborn babies to twelve years old and provides them with personalized care, balanced nutrition, transportation, educational tutoring, and recreation, as well as professional medical, psychological, and social care. Above all, the children of The Hogar receive a lot of love to help them heal their emotional wounds and enable them to move forward in life, focusing in studying, and loving God and the neighbor. Over the years, The Hogar has housed more than 740 children from 44 different municipalities in Puerto Rico.</p>
