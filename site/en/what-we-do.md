      <p>The Hogar's mission is to provide a safe and welcoming place for
      children who have been removed from their biological family or foster home
      due to neglect, physical violence or sexual abuse. We work hard to restore
      the children's physical, mental and emotional wellbeing by providing
      professional attention and personalized care.</p><p>We serve children from
      all over Puerto Rico referred to us by the Department of Family Services.
      In the past 29 years, the Hogar has housed more than <strong>740 minors
      from over 43 Puerto Rico municipalities</strong>.</p><p>Currently, the
      Hogar has a maximum capacity of 20 children and employs a staff of 29
      people, whose main focus is to take care of the children.</p><p>The
      "spinal cord" of the Hogar are the Nanas, caregivers dedicated to the
      children 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our nannies become the children's
      substitute moms during their stay at the Hogar, taking care of them with
      tenderness and attending to their personal hygiene, nutrition and
      recreation.</p><p>Our service staff also includes healthcare, education,
      recreation, nutrition and transportation specialists who work hard in
      conjunction with the nannies to make sure that all the children's needs
      are attended to with promptness and excellence.</p><p>Our executive
      director and administrative team work tirelessly to make sure that the
      Hogar runs like a family in harmony, and to assure the operational and
      fiscal stability of the institution.</p>
