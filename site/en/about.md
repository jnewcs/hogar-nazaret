      <p>The Hogar Albergue para Niños Jesús de Nazaret, Inc. (Hogar) is a
      transitory home for boys and girls that have been victims of abuse.</p>

      <p>We provide a safe and positive living environment for the kids,
      ensuring that all their basic needs are met while showering them with
      tender, loving care. Our Hogar is located in the city of Mayagüez, and it
      is registered as a non-profit organization with the Puerto Rico State
      Department (under number 21,066) and as a 501c (3) with the U.S. Internal
      Revenue Service.</p>

      <p>Our Hogar was founded by Don Jesús Morales and his wife Carmen Cordero
      de Morales in 1991, and opened its doors in May 1995. Aware of the growing
      incidence of child abuse, a group of devoted community leaders worked
      tirelessly for almost five years to make the project a reality.</p>

      <p>Our Hogar receives children from newborn to 11 years of age from all
      over Puerto Rico. The boys and girls receive personal attention, medical
      care, balanced nutrition, transportation, educational tutoring,
      recreational and cultural activities, and the professional social and
      psychological support necessary for their emotional and physical
      wellbeing.</p>

      <p>We have an Executive Director who manages the staff and the day-to-day
      operations of the Hogar, and a volunteer Board of Directors that provides
      strategic and fiscal guidance. In addition, a group of kind and dedicated
      volunteers assists with important administrative and development
      activities, including proposal writing, fund-raising, marketing &
      communications, and event relations.</p>

      <p>We invite you to join the Hogar’s family by becoming a Padrino
      (Godfather) o Madrina (Godmother) and provide your time and/or monthly
      financial donations to help fund the children’s services.  For information
      on how to get involved, please contact us at +1 787 831 6161 or complete
      the form on the ‘Contact Us’ section of this website.</p>

      <p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
