      <p>The operation of our shelter home for children (the Hogar) is greatly
      possible thanks to grants and donations from institutions such as United
      Way, government agencies, civic organizations, merchants and private
      companies. However, most important is the support of the COMMUNITY,
      individuals and families that are committed to help El Hogar continue its
      work and make a difference in the lives of its children.</p>
