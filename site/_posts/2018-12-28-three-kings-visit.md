      <p>During the Christmas festivities, the Three Kings stopped by to bring joy to the children of the Hogar. Balthasar, Melchior and Gaspar brought gifts and words of wisdom for each of our children. It was wonderful to watch our children smile as they interacted with the Wise Men.</p>

      <p>The Hogar sincerely thanks the sponsors of such magic visit!</p>
