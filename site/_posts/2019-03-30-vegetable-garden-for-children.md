In March 2019, missionaries from the Family Church of Wisconsin took on the task of planting an orchard and garden for our children. The orchard will provide organic produce such as peppers, pigeon peas and tomatoes for the Hogar’s consumption.

The garden will allow children to enjoy nature, while learning its importance and how to take care of it. In the photo our Executive Director Antoinette Beltrán Meléndez appears with the missionaries who were present. We thank the Family Church for its wonderful initiative!
