      <p>EOn May 24, our Home was chosen as an institution allied to the "Best Community Care Program" of Abarca Healthcare among 50 applicants. We are one of 4 institutions that will receive funding and constant volunteer support over the next three years to offer better medical care to our children.</p>

      <p>The donation will allow us to enable a new area of nursing and acquire medical equipment for the use of the nurse of the Home and of the pediatricians who take care of the children in our facilities. A million thanks to Mr. Jason Borschow, executive director of Abarca, and his team of employees for their trust and donation. God bless you!</p>
