On August 12, our Board of Directors held a field trip at Hacienda Carabali in Río Grande with the Hogar’s management and service staff.

The event was organized in recognition and gratitude for the hard work that these ladies carry out every day to ensure that the Hogar’s operations are efficient, and that the children have everything they need. Thank you all for your arduous work and dedication!
