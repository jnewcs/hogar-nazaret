On November 8, 2018, the Hogar celebrated its Annual General Assembly in which the new board of directors took office in the company of the new executive director, Mrs. Antoinette Beltrán. The new board of directors will be chaired by Prof. Carlos Velázquez.

It was a beautiful evening full of gratitude and camaraderie among sponsors, volunteers and employees of the Hogar. On behalf of our children, a million thanks to Dr. Sandra Arroyo Ferrer (past president of the board) and Mrs. Lydia E. Méndez (past director) for their efforts and dedication toward the fulfillment of the Hogar's  mission. May God bless both of you!
