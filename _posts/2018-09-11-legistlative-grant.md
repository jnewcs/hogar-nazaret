Last September 11 2018, the Department of Justice of Puerto Rico presented a grant to the Hogar, funded by  the V.O.C.A. legislative donations program. Our director, Antoinette Beltrán, received the donation from Mrs. Wanda Vázquez Garced, Secretary of Justice, in the presence of the Honorable Governor of Puerto Rico. The ceremony took place in the city of San Juan.

On behalf of the Board of Directors and the children of the Hogar, A MILLION THANKS to the DOJ and the Legislature of Puerto Rico for their generous donation. Many blessings!
