Mr. Lowell Blackman took the initiative to raise funds for the Hogar among his friends. He then went personally to the Hogar to deliver the donation on March 19, 2019.

We greatly appreciate Mr. Blackmanâ€™s initiative and generosity. In the photo, Mr. Lowell Blackman presenting the donation to our Director.
