On Friday, May 8, the Hogar conmmorated Teacher's Day by giving a recognition to our children who completed their school year. We sincerely thank our tutoring teacher, Carmen Arce Cruz, and our educational activities coordinator, Silvia RÃ­os Lopez, for their dedication. Congratulations to both the children and the teachers!
