**April** is the month of child abuse prevention. Violence against children includes physical and mental abuse, abandonment or neglect, exploitation, and sexual abuse.  We call on all citizens of the Island to ensure the safety, protection and quality of life of all children in Puerto Rico. To love and protect our children, and report child abuse is everyone's responsibility. We invite you to support our mission!
