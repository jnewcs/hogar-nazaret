Over the past two decades, numerous civic organizations, corporate teams, university students and religious groups have visited the Hogar Albergue para Niños Jesús de Nazaret. We welcome your group to come and share your love, time, skills, donations and celebrations with our children.

For more information on how to schedule your group's visit, please contact us at {% include phone.html %} or complete the following application form. Once you send us the online application, you will receive a telephone call from our office as soon as possible.
