We offer the option of creating a donation fund to benefit the Hogar and direct the funds to your preferred kind of expenses: clothing and nutrition, education and recreation, medical services, mental health, or general expenses.

<b>Businesses and Companies</b>: Merchants and corporations may start a fund under their company's name to benefit the Hogar by making an initial monetary donation and gradually adding to that fund through fundraising activities with their employees.
