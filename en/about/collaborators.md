Since its inception, the Hogar's operation has been possible thanks to the financial support of governmental agencies, private foundations, religious and civic organizations, local merchants and corporations, and residents of the city of Mayagüez and surrounding cities.

The Hogar's Board of Directors gives its most sincere thanks to the following organizations and individuals for their generosity. <b>Thank you for your contribution!</b>
