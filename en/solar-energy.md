The transitory home for children Jesús de Nazaret in Mayagüez (Hogar) has a new solar energy system that provides electricity in the event of power outages.
The system ensures the continuity of their important services even when natural disasters strike the island.

In addition, the new system provides savings that will enable the addition of new and more specialized services for the children.

The installation of the system was possible thanks to the ingenuity and selfless contribution of a large group of people, entities and companies that contributed their expertise, time and money.
